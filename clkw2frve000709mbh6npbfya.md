Setting up a comfortable pipeline to compile your SCSS files can be quite a chore and sometimes frustrating ðŸ˜“. You may come across numerous outdated tutorials online, filled with unnecessary details and bloated configurations.

But don't worry, I've got you covered with a simple and efficient pipeline that will take less than 5 minutes to set up, I promise! ðŸ’ª Once you follow my easy tutorial, you'll be able to compile all your SCSS files into a single CSS file.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. If you haven't already, start by initializing npm in your project:
    

```makefile
npm init
```

1. Next, install the necessary development dependencies:
    

```makefile
npm install gulp gulp-sass node-sass gulp-concat --save-dev
```

1. Now, create a file named `gulpfile.js` in your project's root directory and add the following code snippet:
    

```javascript
javascriptCopy code'use strict';
var gulp = require('gulp');
var sass = require('gulp-sass');
var concat = require('gulp-concat');

sass.compiler = require('node-sass');

gulp.task('sass', function () {
   return gulp.src('./sass/**/*.scss')
   .pipe(concat('custom.scss'))
   .pipe(sass().on('error', sass.logError))
   .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/'));
});
```

ðŸ’¡ Here's how it works: We define a Gulp Task that will search for .scss files in the `/sass` folder. These files will then be concatenated into a single file named `custom.scss`. Finally, the compilation process will convert this `custom.scss` into `custom.css` and save it in the `/dist` folder.

1. To make things easier, add the gulp task to your `package.json` file under the `scripts` section:
    

```javascript
jsonCopy code"scripts": {
   "scss": "gulp sass"
},
```

Great job! ðŸš€ Now you're all set!

To compile all your .scss files into one single .css file, simply run the following command:

```javascript
npm run scss
```

After that, you can easily import your `custom.css` into your project, just like you used to do before (e.g., include it in your HTML header or JS module).
